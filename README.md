Dreidel is a traditional Chanukah game with a four-sided spinning top and tokens to be won or lost. 

Here is how to play:
Each player spins initially. The player with the highest spin goes first, and after that you go clockwise. 
  If two players both have the highest spin then they should each spin again until there is a clear winner.

Spin results: <ol>
  <li>Nun means “nisht” or “nothing.” The player does nothing.</li>
  <li>Gimel  means “gantz” or “everything.” The player gets everything in the pot.</li>
  <li>Hey means “halb” or “half.” The player gets half of the pot. (If there is an odd number of pieces in the pot, the player takes half of the total plus one).</li>
  <li>Shin (outside of Israel) means “shtel” or “put in.”</li> </ol>

When a player runs out of tokens, they are out. 
When one player has all of the tokens in the game (i.e. there are no tokens in the pot and every other player is out) then they have won and the game is over.

The mythology has grown up around the dreidel, that the Hebrew letters on the side (and the coins or nuts as tokens) were a method of teaching children Hebrew (specifically, at a time when this was forbidden by the Seleucid empire). 
Hopefully, coding this console app is a way for me to learn a new language too!
